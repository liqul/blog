I received my Ph.D. on computer science from Institute of software Chinese academy of sciences in 2012 under supervision of Prof. Limin Sun, and B.E. from department of Computer science and technology at Tsinghua University in 2006. I visited Michigan State University in 2009 as a visiting scholar supervised by Dr. Guoliang Xing. </p>

<h3><span id="projects">Projects</span></h3><h4><span id="analysis-oriented-object-storage">Analysis-oriented Object Storage</span></h4><p><img src="/blog/assets/object.png" width="400" style="float:left"> Storing files is easy than analyzing them, especially if you have a large number of files. In this project, our goal is to build an object storage service which is capable of hold a large number of files while offering easy interface for analysis. For this purpose, we introduce a new data model, i.e., a object = metadata + file. The metadata is an abstract of each file, which we store into a data storage engine, such as MySQL or Elasticsearch. Any analysis framework could find interested files from various dimensions. We keep the file in HDFS, which is the native file system for the Hadoop ecosystem. Mapreduce or Spark can directly read the files without making a copy on the fly which is usually costy in terms of both time and space. To prevent from the “small-file-problem”, we run a background daemon processing continuously compacting small files into big ones. </p>

<h4><span id="transportation-activity-recognition-on-smartphones">Transportation Activity Recognition on Smartphones</span></h4><p><img src="/blog/assets/architecture.jpg" width="250" style="float:left"> In some data collection applications, it is useful to know your user’s transportation status. For instance, for a map maintainer, knowing the transportation status helps to distinguish if the data is collected on road, sidewalk, or in building. However, it is nontrivial to approach a high accuracy. Practical challenges include unknown phone gesture, random noises, and achieving high energy efficiency. I designed a framework combining both inputs from the inertial sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) and various contextual informations. Extraneous events incurred by user random activities are filtered with intuitive rules discovered through our training data from tens of people. We finally achieved a significantly better accuracy compared with existing frameworks from Google and Samsung.</p>
<h4><span id="indoor-localization"></span></h4><p><img src="/blog/assets/localization.jpg" alt="Localization"></p>
<p>Localization in indoor areas is nontrivial due to the fact that GPS signals cannot penetrate walls. To tackle this challenge, we leverage various signals, e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Geomagnetic field, IMU sensors, and even visible light, which are commonly found in indoor environment. </p>
<p>Specifically, we proposed a Wi-Fi based positioning system called <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/jump/221298" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Modellet</em></a>. Modellet takes advantage of both fingerprint-based and model-based approaches, and is able to adapt to environmental locality and training data density. We evaluate Modellet with data collected from venues (office, airport, and shopping mall) across China, Germany, and the U.S. We show that Modellet outperforms Radar and EZPerfect. Secondly, we build a system called <a href="https://kabru.eecs.umich.edu/yuanchao/paper/jsac15magicol.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Magicol</em></a> adding more modalities, i.e., Geomagnetic field and IMU sensors, to the system to improve localization accuracy. We leverage the particle filter framework to fuse the signals. Evaluation results show that Magicol achieves around 2-meter accuracy in office and shopping mall areas. Finally, we explore the possibility of positioning with visible light emitted from LEDs. LED bulbs are modified to blink in unique patterns (invisible to human eyes). Any device with a light sensor can decode and estimate its own postion based on the light energy propagation model. The system is called <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/209511/epsilon-cameraready.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Epsilon</em></a> which achieves submeter-level accuracy. </p>
<h4><span id="wireless-sensor-network"></span></h4><p><img src="/blog/assets/sensor.jpg" alt="Sensor Networking"></p>
<p>Wireless sensor network (WSN) typically refers to a large number of networked embedded devices, called sensor nodes. In WSNs, data is transmitted from one node to another in a multi-hop minor. WSNs are usually deployed in harsh environments like in forest or around volcano, and therefore the nodes face frequent failures. I studied several issues raised from WSNs. Specifically, I develop voice-streaming systems (namely <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~glxing/docs/voice_icdcs09.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QVS</a> and <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~glxing/docs/asm_rtss10.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASM</a>) which are aware of the voice quality. These systems prevent the problem of network congestion with an admission control protocol. I also investigate the <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~glxing/docs/rds-li.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">time synchronization</a> problem where we need to maintain accurate relative time between sensor nodes. I exploit the regular pattern of the RDS data carried by the FM radio signal for energy efficient millisecond-level time synchronization in city-scale sensor networks. </p>
